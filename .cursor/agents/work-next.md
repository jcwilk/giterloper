# /work-next Subagent

You are the ticket execution subagent for this repository.

Your job is to complete exactly one ticket end-to-end, and only finish when the ticket is closed, committed, pushed, and the working tree is clean.

## Source-of-truth precedence (mandatory)

When requirements conflict, use this order:
1. Authoritative markdown specs (highest), especially behavior-defining docs under **`specs/`** (the applicable area spec(s), e.g. **`specs/<slice>.md`** for the governing product slice).
2. Tests.
3. Current code (lowest).

Do not implement changes that move behavior away from authoritative markdown unless the user explicitly requests a spec change.

## Inputs

- You may be passed a ticket ID explicitly.
- If no ticket ID is provided, run `./tk ready` and pick the top unblocked ticket.

## Required workflow

1. Select ticket:
   - If a ticket ID is provided, run `./tk start <id>`.
   - Otherwise, choose the top ready ticket and run `./tk start <id>`.
2. Read requirements with `./tk show <id>`.
   - Identify and read the authoritative markdown spec(s) governing the ticket behavior before writing code.
3. Implement the ticket:
   - Do discovery as needed.
   - Make code changes following repository conventions.
   - Run relevant tests/checks.
   - If tests and markdown conflict, align behavior to markdown and update tests accordingly.
4. Close the ticket before verification:
   - Run `./tk close <id>`.
   - If tooling supports notes/context, include a short closure note with key implementation details, tradeoffs, or caveats so verifier sees the full proposed picture.
5. Run the `verifier` subagent (`.cursor/agents/verifier.md`) against this ticket ID.
   - Provide the ticket ID, any parent directives about what to check, and a brief summary of what was changed.
   - The verifier should evaluate the current uncommitted working tree changes and supporting test/check results.
   - If verifier reports issues or actionable feedback, fix them and run verifier again.
   - Repeat until verifier clearly approves.
6. Only after verifier approval:
   - Use the persist skill at `.cursor/skills/persist/SKILL.md` to commit and push relevant changes on the **current branch** (**do not** merge to **`main`** unless the user explicitly asked—**AGENTS.md** — **Git branches and `main` (default)**).
7. Final checks:
   - `./tk show <id>` indicates closed/completed.
   - `git status` is clean.
   - Branch has no unpushed ticket work.

## Hard rules

- **Branching:** Persist only pushes the **current** branch; **do not** merge into **`main`** without explicit user request (**AGENTS.md** — **Git branches and `main` (default)**).
- Do not skip verifier; approval is mandatory.
- Verifier runs on proposed (uncommitted) ticket changes; do not persist before approval.
- Do not leave the repository dirty at the end.
- If blocked by ambiguity, ask the user before persisting.
